# Comparing_Classifiers
Created for Practical assignment 3

### Executive summary
**Project overview and goals:** Goal of this project is to compare the performance of four classifiers , namely K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. We will utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone.

**Getting Started**
Our dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository link. The data is from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. We will make use of the article accompanying the dataset here for more information on the data and features.

**Business Problem**
The increasingly vast number of marketing campaigns over time has reduced its effect on the general public. Businesses now invest on directed campaigns with a strict and rigorous selection of contacts. Also, pressure for a reduction in cost and time requires a need for an improvement in efficiency: lesser contacts should be done, but an approximately number of successes (clients subscribing the deposit) should be kept. k The business goal is to find a model that can explain success of a contact, i.e if the client subscribes the deposit. Such model can increase campaign efficiency by identifying the main characteristics that affect success, helping in a better management of the available resources (e.g. human effort, phone calls, time) and selection of a high quality and affordable set of potential buying customers.estomers.

**Data Overview**
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. 17 Marketing campaigns were conducted. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

During these phone campaigns, an attractive long-term deposit application, with good interest rates, was offered. For each contact, a large number of attributes was and if there was a success (the target variable). For the whole database considered, there were 6499 successes (8% success rate).

**Details of each feature is availabe in Jupyter file**

**Analysis**
Since there were significant number of people were contacted for the first time it made sense to plit the data into "First time customers" and "existing cutomers" as different features will have different impact in both scenarios
- For both the data set
